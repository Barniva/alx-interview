# 🔐 LockBoxes Challenge 🔐

Welcome to the LockBoxes Challenge! This project is part of the `alx-interview` repository.

## 📝 Description 📝

This project contains a Python script that determines if all boxes can be opened. You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

## 📦 How It Works 📦

A key with the same number as a box opens that box. You can assume all keys will be positive integers. There can be keys that do not have boxes. The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked. The function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, else returns `False`.

## 🚀 Usage 🚀

Run the `main_0.py` script to test the `canUnlockAll` function with different sets of boxes.

```bash
$ ./main_0.py
```
