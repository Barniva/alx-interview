# 📐 Pascal's Triangle Generator 📐

This repository contains a Python script that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows. 🎉

## 📝 Description 📝

The script `0-pascal_triangle.py` generates a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's Triangle of `n`. It's a simple yet powerful tool for mathematical computations and patterns. 🧮

## 🌟 Features 🌟

- Handles edge case of `n <= 0` by returning an empty list. 🚫
- Always expects `n` to be an integer. 🔢

## 🚀 Usage 🚀

Import the function and call it with the desired number of rows. Here's a quick example:

```python
pascal_triangle = __import__('0-pascal_triangle').pascal_triangle
print(pascal_triangle(5))
```

This will generate the first 5 rows of Pascal's Triangle. 🎯

## 📂 Repository Structure 📂

- `0-pascal_triangle.py`: The main script with the `pascal_triangle(n)` function. 📜
- `0-main.py`: A test file that prints Pascal's Triangle of 5. 🧪
