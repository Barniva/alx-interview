# Rotate 2D Matrix :arrows_counterclockwise:

This repository contains a Python script that rotates an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

## Task :clipboard:

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix must be edited in-place. You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.

## Usage :computer:

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
./main_0.py
```

## Example :eyes:

Here's an example of how the script works:

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]

rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)
print(matrix)
```

Output:

```bash
[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]
```
